Welcome to the "Visualize Sorting Algorithms with React" project! This project aims to provide an interactive way to visualize various sorting algorithms using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Sorting algorithms are fundamental in computer science and are used to arrange elements of a list or array in a specific order. However, understanding how these algorithms work can be challenging, especially for beginners. This project seeks to make the learning process more engaging and intuitive by providing visual representations of sorting algorithms in action.

Using this application, users can interactively observe how different sorting algorithms, such as bubble sort, quick sort, and merge sort, operate on a given set of data. By visualizing the algorithms step by step, users can gain a better understanding of their inner workings and performance characteristics.

Whether you're a student learning about sorting algorithms for the first time or a seasoned developer looking to refresh your knowledge, "Visualize Sorting Algorithms with React" offers a valuable learning experience. Dive in, explore different algorithms, and enhance your understanding of sorting techniques in a fun and interactive way!




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
